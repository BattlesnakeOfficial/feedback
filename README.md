# Help Inform the Future of Battlesnake

**Welcome to the Battlesnake Feedback Repository, your space to share ideas, report bugs, and request features that can help inform the future of the Battlesnake platform and community.**

[![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Have%20Some%20Feedback%3F-Join%20the%20Discussion-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions)

Rather than reporting issues in each repository, [battlesnakeofficial/feedback](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback) provides a central space for the Battlesnake Product team to receive feedback and suggestions, using the [General](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions/categories/general) category for more global issues, and categories for our existing public repositries and community spaces including:

|**Repositories** | **Other**|
|---|---|
|[Rules]()|[Store](https://store.battlesnake.com)|
|[Docs]()|[Discord](https://play.battlesnake.com/discord)|
|[Exporter]()||
|[Board]()||

## Contributing Your Feedback

First things first, take a look through previous discussions to see if your suggestion already exists, and if you find a suggestion similar to what you are thinking, simply add an up-vote or join into the existing community discussion.

If you can't find something similar, we encourage you to open a discussion following the [instruction provided here](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions/1).

## Disclaimer

While the Battlesnake team will carefully consider every bug and feature request carefully, we are unable to make any guarentees that feedback provided in these discussions will actually be developed or delivered.
